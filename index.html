    <h2>Hello</h2>

<h3>Design & Development </h3>
<p>I started learning programming when I decided to build a new career after being unable to pursue my own profession. I chose web development, which is already a topic I am interested in, and now I am progressing on this path. During high school, I had tried to learn programming a few times but wasn't successful. However, things are going well now. I have improved myself in HTML and CSS, and next up is JavaScript. So exciting!</p>

<h3>Curiosity</h3>
<p>I believe my most important trait is my curiosity, desire to research, and eagerness to learn. In web development and everything I do in my daily life, I always strive to complete tasks in the best way possible and look for ways to improve myself. I believe that having knowledge in different fields enriches a person.</p>
